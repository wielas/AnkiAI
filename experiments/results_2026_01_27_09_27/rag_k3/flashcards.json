    "question": "Why is it impractical to configure all followers as synchronous in leader-based replication, and what approach is commonly used instead?",
    "answer": "If all followers were synchronous, any single node outage would block all writes and halt the entire system since the leader must wait for all followers to confirm. Instead, databases typically use semi-synchronous replication where only one follower is synchronous while others are asynchronous, guaranteeing an up-to-date copy on at least two nodes (leader and one synchronous follower) without risking complete system unavailability.",
