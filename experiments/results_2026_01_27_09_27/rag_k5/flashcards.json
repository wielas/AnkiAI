    "question": "Why is it impractical to configure all followers as synchronous in leader-based replication, and what compromise is typically used instead?",
    "answer": "If all followers were synchronous, any single node outage would halt the entire system since the leader must wait for all followers to confirm writes. The typical compromise is semi-synchronous replication, where one follower is synchronous (guaranteeing an up-to-date copy on at least two nodes) and the others are asynchronous, with another follower promoted to synchronous if the current one becomes unavailable.",

    "answer": "If all followers were synchronous, any single node outage would block all writes and halt the entire system, since the leader must wait for confirmation from every follower before processing writes. In practice, systems use semi-synchronous replication (one synchronous follower, others asynchronous) to balance data durability with system availability.",
