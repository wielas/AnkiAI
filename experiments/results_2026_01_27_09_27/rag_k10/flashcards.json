    "question": "Why is it impractical to configure all followers as synchronous in leader-based replication, and what approach is typically used instead?",
    "answer": "If all followers are synchronous, any single node failure would block all writes and halt the entire system since the leader must wait for confirmation from all replicas. Instead, databases typically use semi-synchronous replication where only one follower is synchronous while others are asynchronous, guaranteeing an up-to-date copy on at least two nodes (leader and one synchronous follower) without complete system blocking.",
