    "question": "How does monotonic reads guarantee differ from eventual consistency, and what is a common implementation strategy to achieve it?",
    "answer": "Monotonic reads guarantees that if a user makes several reads in sequence, they will not see time go backward (i.e., not read older data after reading newer data), which is stronger than eventual consistency but weaker than strong consistency. It is commonly implemented by ensuring each user always reads from the same replica, often by routing based on a hash of the user ID.",

    "question": "How does the consistent prefix reads guarantee prevent causality violations in distributed databases with replication lag?",
    "answer": "Consistent prefix reads ensures that if a sequence of writes happens in a certain order, anyone reading those writes will see them appear in the same order. This prevents scenarios where causally dependent data (like a question and its answer) appear out of sequence due to different replication speeds across partitions, which would violate causality.",

    "question": "What problem does the consistent prefix reads guarantee solve in distributed databases with partitioned data?",
    "answer": "Consistent prefix reads ensures that if a sequence of writes happens in a certain order, readers will see them in the same order, preventing causality violations. This is particularly important in partitioned databases where different partitions may replicate at different speeds, which could otherwise cause observers to see effects before their causes (e.g., seeing an answer before the question that prompted it).",

  {
    "question": "Why does the consistent prefix reads anomaly particularly occur in partitioned databases, and how does it violate causality?",
    "answer": "In partitioned databases, different partitions operate independently without a global ordering of writes. This means a reader may see some partitions in a newer state and others in an older state, causing causally related writes (like a question and its answer) to appear out of order. This violates causality because an effect can appear to occur before its cause.",

In contrast, single-leader replication requires every write to go over the internet to the datacenter with the leader, adding significant latency.",

This is architecturally equivalent to multi-datacenter multi-leader replication taken to the extreme, where each device is a \"datacenter\" connected by extremely unreliable networks, with replication lag potentially spanning hours or days.",
